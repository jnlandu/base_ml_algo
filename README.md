# base_ml_algo: 

Developing version of the implementation of basic machine learning algorithms taught/discussed in class at the AIMS AMMI program (visit https://aimsammi.org/)


### Short details

This repository contains assignmemts, tests, quizes, and projects, that we did/will be doing  the AIMS AMMI program. For the actual version, no much is done althought some a few works are already uploaded, notaby the implementation:
* gradient descent method and its variants: Mini-Bacth GD  and Stochastic GD.
* logistic regression, implementaion from scratch. The details about the dataset used will be given later.
* linear regression, likewise, details for the the datasets will be discussed later.
Most of those codes are written in python and use several packages libraies such as `numpy`, `pandas`,`pytorch`, etc.

### Changes from now to March 31, 2024
We aim to:
* improve the code just upload, broaden it and include more features that could not appear.
* improve also the readability of the codes
* add related (short courses/short summary) of each concepts and/or techniques used
* have the same codes but written in `R` (or `Julia`).

### Datasets
For  most of the present codes, we use the dataset provided by an appropriate library/package. For instance for the logistic implementation, the wide-known dataset `iris` from  `sklearn` was used to test our codes.
